The original game was made because James said "I'm going to burn down your fence!" and my friend made it on a Scratch project in retaliation to it. At the end of the day, it is all jokes, so don't take this too seriously, and it is supposed to be absurd and comedic (after all, who would accept ashes as payment!?!?). Oh, Frank is my other friend and he is tech savvy so I put him on the website also. If you were wondering, no, Frank does not have automatic burners.</div><a href="../index.html"><strong>Back to home page</strong></a></div><script src="fence.js"></script></body></html>
