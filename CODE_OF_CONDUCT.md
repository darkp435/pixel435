# Code of Conduct
*(nobody is probably gonna read this anyways but I might as well write this.)*

Welcome to pixel435! I welcome all people to this project, and everybody who wants to contribute is accepted.

This project is powered by passion, curiosity, passion, and curiosity. To keep things fun and (hopefully) functional, here are the codes of conduct, also "I" refers to darkp435:

- **Be kind to one another.**
  *If you can’t, still do. I have low standards.*
- **No jerks.**
  *If you’re not sure if you're being a jerk, you are, and that shall not be tolerated.*
- **Help other people if you can, we want to be supportive**
  *But also, **don’t be that person who asks for help without even trying first**.*
- **Feedback is great, but try to make it kind!**
  *Otherwise, it's just "critiquing," and I don't have time for critiques.*
- **Please **do not** create ASCII art of the rickroll and paste it in the documentation or code comments.**
  *I don't think I need to elaborate further*
- **Do not summon Cthulhu in the documentation, or any mythical beings at all (includes herobrine).**
  *This includes summoning eldritch horrors via poorly written code.*
- **If your code requires any other things for build, like extra dependencies, version control, blood, etc., please document it clearly.**
  *Also, no blood donations will be accepted on the repo. I am not a vampire, so don't treat me like one.*
- **No AI-generated Shrek fanfiction in the documentation unless I approve of it (which is never).**
  *Just, no.*
- **Do not convert the entire project to use tabs. Just, don't. I probably won't notice, but still don't.**
  *You will be humiliated once I find out.*
- **If you find a bug and it turns out to be a feature, congratulations, you’re now the maintainer of said feature and if said feature causes any trouble, you now have to take care of it.**
  *You’re the proud owner of that terrible idea that should've been resolved 5 commits earlier.*
- **Please do not write your humanities essays in this repo or your study notes.**
  *Unless it’s interesting or funny, in which I will personally approve it because I, darkp435, have all power in this repo.*
- **Do not paste links to specifically cat videos inside the documentation.**
  *Just to be safe, you never know what might be in the documentation.*
- **DO NOT SPOIL EPISODE 1071 OF ONE PIECE**, JUST DON'T.  
  *You will be flamed for such actions.*
- **If you accidentally do something wild, just own it. I respect that.**
- **Do not submit code with "TODO: fix this later" unless you're 100% sure you’re going to fix it later, or your darkp435.**
  *Procrastination should be negated.*
- **Do not engage in flame wars unless they are genuinely interesting, like pineapple on pizza, in which case it is acceptable.**
  *Oh yeah pineapple on  pizza is bad.*
- **No weapons of mass destruction, this includes, this includes thermonuclear warheads**
  *Just, no.*

Let’s build cool stuff, keep things fun, and never, ever take ourselves too seriously. I might add emojis later but I can't be bothered right now.
