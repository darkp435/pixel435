This website has been created by darkp435, because he was bored. Currently, this website is on version
2.0, with 7 currently working projects. All of the software on this website was created by darkp
himself. Do whatever you want here, as there are no rules. This website is aimed to be jerseysoft,
but better, which was created by my friend. This is been a personal project and developed all by
myself, and I hope you enjoy visiting it as much as I enjoyed making it.

(FYI: The 'p' in darkp stands for 'pixel')
